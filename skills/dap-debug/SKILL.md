description: Interactively debug source code — set breakpoints, step through execution line by line, inspect live variable state, evaluate expressions against the running program, and navigate the call stack to trace root causes. Use when a program crashes, raises unexpected exceptions, produces wrong output, when you need to understand how execution reached a certain state, or when print-statement debugging isn't revealing enough.

# Interactive Debugger

Use when a program crashes, produces wrong output, or you need to understand exactly
how execution reached a particular state — and running it again with more print statements
won't give you the answer fast enough.

**Prerequisite:** `dap` must be installed. If it's missing or a backend fails, run the `dap-setup` skill first.

**Think like a developer sitting at a debugger.** Each pause is an observation. Each
observation either confirms your current theory about the bug or disproves it and points
somewhere new. You're not guessing — you're surgically stopping execution where the
truth lives and reading it directly.

## Starting a Session

`dap debug <file>` launches the program under the debugger. Backend is auto-detected from the file extension.

Choose your starting strategy based on what you know:

- **Have a hypothesis** — set a breakpoint where you expect the bug: `dap debug script.py --break script.py:42`
- **Multi-file app** — breakpoints across modules: `--break src/api/routes.py:55 --break src/models/user.py:30`
- **No hypothesis, small program** — walk from entry: `dap debug script.py --stop-on-entry` (avoid for large projects — startup code is noisy; bisect with breakpoints instead)
- **Exception, location unknown** — `dap debug script.py --break-on-exception raised` (Python) / `all` (Go/JS)
- **Remote process / build system** — `dap debug --attach host:port --backend <name>` (**use absolute paths for `--break`**)

**Session isolation:** `--session <name>` keeps concurrent agents from interfering.
`$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is injected by startup hooks; use a short descriptive name as fallback (e.g. `--session myapp`).

**Adding breakpoints mid-session** — no need to restart:
```bash
dap break --break app.py:55
dap break --break app.py:55:x > 10   # conditional
dap break --break app.py:55 --break app.py:80   # multiple at once
```
Existing breakpoints are preserved. Use this when you stop somewhere and realise you need to pause elsewhere next.

Run `dap debug --help` or `dap break --help` for all flags.

## The Debugging Mindset

Debugging is investigation, not guessing. Every action should test a specific hypothesis. Don't change code hoping it
fixes something. Understand first, fix after.

**Debugging is almost always iterative.** Your first hypothesis will often be wrong or incomplete. That's expected.
Each stop gives you new information that refines or replaces your hypothesis. The loop is:

**Observe → Hypothesize → Act → Observe → ...**

Embrace it. A single breakpoint rarely reveals the root cause; three stops that eliminate possibilities are progress.

## Know Your State

Every `dap` execution command returns full context automatically: current location, source, locals, call stack, and
output. At each stop, ask:

- Do the local variables have the values I expected?
- Is the call stack showing the code path I expected?
- Does the output so far reveal anything unexpected?

Example output at a stop:

```
Stopped at compute() · script.py:41
  39:   def compute(items):
  40:       result = None
> 41:       return result
Locals: items=[]  result=None
Stack:  main [script.py:10] → compute [script.py:41]
Output: (none)
```

If the program exits before hitting your breakpoint:

```
Program terminated · Exit code: 1
```

→ Move breakpoints earlier, or restart with `--stop-on-entry`.

## Forming a Hypothesis

Before setting a breakpoint: *"I believe the bug is in X because Y."* A good hypothesis is falsifiable — your next
observation will confirm or disprove it. No hypothesis yet? Bisect with two breakpoints to narrow the search space, or see starting strategies above.

## Setting Breakpoints Strategically

- Set where the problem *begins*, not where it *manifests*
- Exception at line 80? Root cause is upstream — start earlier
- Uncertain? Bisect: `--break f:20 --break f:60` — wrong state before or after halves the search space

**Conditional breakpoints** — stop only when an expression is true:
```bash
dap debug app.py --break app.py:42:x > 100
dap debug app.py --break app.py:15:user.role == "admin"
dap debug app.py --break app.py:8:len(items) == 0
```
Use `file:line:condition` syntax. The condition is evaluated in the stopped frame's scope.

## Navigating Execution

At each stop, choose how to advance based on what you suspect:

```bash
dap step        # step over — trust this call, advance to next line
dap step in     # step into — suspect what's inside this function
dap step out    # step out — you're in the wrong place, return to caller
dap continue    # jump to next breakpoint
dap context     # re-inspect current state without stepping (after continue)
dap output      # drain buffered stdout/stderr without full context
```

`step in` crosses file boundaries — execution follows the call into whatever module it lives in. Each stop shows the
current `file:line` so you always know where you are.

Use `dap eval "<expr>"` to probe live state without stepping:

```bash
dap eval "len(items)"
dap eval "user.profile.settings"
dap eval "expected == actual"       # test hypothesis on live state
dap eval "self.config" --frame 1    # frame 1 = caller (may be a different file)
```

Run `dap step --help`, `dap eval --help`, etc. for details.

## Walkthrough

**Bug: `compute()` returns `None`**

```
Hypothesis: result not assigned before return
→ dap debug script.py --break script.py:41
  Locals: result=None, items=[]   ← wrong, and input is also empty

New hypothesis: caller passing empty list
→ dap eval "items" --frame 1      → []   ← confirmed
→ dap step out                    → caller at line 10, no guard for empty input

Root cause: missing guard. Fix → dap stop.
```

**No hypothesis (exception, unknown location):**

```
Exception: TypeError, location unknown
→ dap debug script.py --break-on-exception raised
  Stopped at compute():41, items=None
Root cause: None passed where list expected.
```

## Cleanup

```bash
dap stop                    # default session
dap stop --session myapp    # named session
```
